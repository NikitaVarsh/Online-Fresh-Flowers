            Newspapers are an important part of our life. Some people cannot start their day without reading newspapers. 
            They are printed in various languages and even in local languages. Newspapers are delivered to our doorsteps every morning.
            Newspapers are one of the easiest methods of spreading news and information around the world. There might be those who read
            every single news article, irrespective of what they speak about. There are also people who read only what interests them. 
            For some, it might be politics; for some, it might be sports; while for others, it might be technology. Though the number 
            of people subscribing to printed newspapers is reducing day by day, there are still some who prefer reading them rather
            than the digital versions of the news on their personal phones or laptops.
